Airbnb KCL

Our objective in this coursework was to provide the user with a user-friendly and realistic Airbnb application utilizing a database.
To achieve this, we used a different CSV file containing more information about each listing. 
The core of the GUI is the MainFrame which can display several panels and provide functionality for user interaction.

The libraries for our project have to be added manually.
They are all placed in the Libraries folder.
